# Project Outline
The project is about predicting people's income above 50k annually in the USA.Observation was mainly from people with different working class, education, education numbers attended,race,marital status, occupation, relationship, sex, capital gain, capital loss, native country, hours per week. The project started by importing the data from USA Labour Bufor labour bu

The project started by building a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset. The characteristics of the houses was also shown using some business intelligence tool such as Tableau. Some of iteretsing questions were answered through the assist of SQL in understanding the data challenge.

# Scenario
You are working as an analyst for a real estate company. Your company wants to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.

# Objectives
1. Can features predict if someone earns annual Income of above 50k?
2. Is number of male and female equally earns above 50k?
3. What is the income differences between races?

# Data
With a colossal sum of data accessible, we investigated a number of diverse sources. Hence CSV file was downloaded and prepared for the data analysis. Using Python we were able to conduct various steps to reach the analyis and reporting stage. we scratched a number of diverse tables into Pandas Dataframes and began to investigate and clean the data. After finalizing with the data cleaning, we sent out the clean dataframes to CSV files to be utilized for assist investigation in SQL.

# Database
Investigating the data given and considering approximately how to interface it together, we use an ERD for how we needed our database to see and act. Utilizing MySQL, we made a modern pattern, and imported the CSV record from the  Python Jupyter notebook  which enabled us to go further with analysis.

# Visualisation
Through the use of Tableau we were  able to effectively envision distinctive  plots such as the distribution plots of different variables (independent and dependent) and creation of a visually appealing dashboard to represent the information.

# Conclusion
Python was used to clean and sent out a few datasets. Utilizing the data at that point built a machine learning and use MySQL to meet our numerous objectives. As the data given was moderately straight forward, we had parcels of time to test with the visualisations in Scene through the use of Tableau , making a collection of outwardly engaging dashboards that offer curiously understanding.
